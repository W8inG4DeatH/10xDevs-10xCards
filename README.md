## Project Name

10xDevs-10xCards

## Project Description

10xDevs-10xCards is a flashcard application designed to streamline the process of creating and managing high-quality flashcards. This project leverages AI to generate flashcard suggestions based on provided text input, and allows for both automated and manual flashcard creation. It aims to simplify and accelerate the spaced repetition learning method by reducing the time and effort required for flashcard generation and management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Astro 5, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4, Shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, authentication)
- **AI Integration:** Openrouter.ai (access to various LLM models)
- **Testing:**
  - **Unit & Integration Tests:** Vitest, React Testing Library, MSW, Faker.js
  - **End-to-End Tests:** Playwright (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit), @axe-core/playwright
  - **Code Coverage:** c8, codecov
- **CI/CD & Hosting:** GitHub Actions, DigitalOcean (Docker)
